<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> This week's focus in terms of a practical hands-on task if on Machine Learning in the Cloud. </p>
<p>In this workshop you will:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i) Learn how to use cloud-based AI/ML tools to train a model that provides predictions  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Qwiklabs:</h1>
<p style="color:red">Note: you must not use your personal Google account details for Qwiklabs, you only use the temporary Qwiklabs credentials supplied to in the Qwiklabs lab, these credentionals are only valid for ONE use and will change if you need to run the lab again. See example below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two labs to choose from this week, there is no need to do both as they will each give you a flavour of working with cloud-based ML tools. The first lab (11a) is around 1 hour, while the second lab is 2 hours (11b).</p>
<h3>Lab 11a</h3>
<p>In this lab you will upload images to Cloud Storage and use them to train a custom model to recognize different types of clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, etc.), complete the<strong> AI Platform: Qwik Start </strong> lab <a href="https://run.qwiklabs.com/catalog_lab/676">here.</a></p>
<h3>Lab 11b</h3>
<p>In this lab you will upload images to Cloud Storage and use them to train a custom model to recognize different types of clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, etc.), complete the<strong> Classify Images of Clouds in the Cloud with AutoML Vision </strong> lab <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/1094">here.</a></p>
