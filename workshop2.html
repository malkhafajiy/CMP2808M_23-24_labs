<p> This workshop will introduce you to deploying cloud resources through IaC (infrastructure-as-code) using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/language">Terraform.</a> Please refer to this week's lecture slides to learn more about IaC. This is an important part of designing infrastructure and a staple skill of cloud DevOps.</p>
<p>In this workshop you will learn:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i) Terraform configuration and syntax fundamentals;</p>
  <p>ii) Modifying cloud infrastructure using Terraform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminder: for all Terraform tasks you need to use the Cloud Skills Boost platform, if you have not yet signed up to the platform yet then please follow the instructions in workshop 1.</p>
<p>Please first watch the short video below:</p>
