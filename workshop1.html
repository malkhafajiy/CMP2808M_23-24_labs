<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before you begin this workshop, please ensure you have completed the form <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/uBn8magfsd">here</a> with your Google email address, as you will be given your own Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project space to use <strong>later</strong> in the module. Google Cloud Project spaces for the module can only be setup by the module coordinator.</p>
<p>This workshop is the first of many the module team have created  to help you pick up the basics of cloud design and development, then progress through to more cloud infrastructure design and development. These workshops are designed to help you understand fundamental cloud concepts and as such it is vital you complete ALL of them. Therefore please take the time to go through all of the workshop . You can also continue working on the workshop tasks from home as the software requirements are basic. You are expected to go beyond the material and tasks presented in the workshops by attempting more advanced tasks and materials.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this workshop is to ensure you have your&nbsp; <strong>Google Cloud Hand-on labs / Qwiklabs account</strong> setup, as well as familiarising yourself with the tools. Qwiklabs is currently undergoing a branding change and will soon be primarily known as <strong>Google Cloud Hands-on Labs</strong> instead of <strong>Qwiklabs</strong>.</p>
<p>When you have completed &nbsp;this workshop you will have &nbsp;learned the basics to:</p>
<p>i) Find your way around Qwiklabs by doing some intro labs;</p>
<p>iii) Gain some practical experience with Google Cloud Project spaces;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Qwiklabs</h2>
<p>Qwiklabs is a learning platform that has deep integration with the Google Cloud Platform, essentially it provides a sandboxed environment for you to complete cloud labs through a browser. As a student on this module you have been given access to Qwiklabs to carry out many of the mandatory workshop tasks and tutorials as part of this module. Each Qwiklab exercise carries a 'credit' weighting, credits are required to do each Qwiklab task and these vary from lab to lab. The module coordinator has been allocated enough credits for all students on the module to complete all labs that are presented in  each workshop.</p>
<p style="color:red"><strong>When you carry out ANY Qwiklab exercise, please always remember that you must use the temporary GCP login details that are listed to the left of each Qwiklab - DO NOT login to Qwiklabs using your own GCP/gmail account details! Your personal GCP project space is only to be used for the independent tasks that are part of later workshops.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Registering and Signing in to Qwiklabs</h3>
<p>Firstly, if you havent already done so, you will need to create a Qwiklabs account <a href="https://www.qwiklabs.com/users/sign_up">here</a> by using your <strong>university email address </strong>- <u>do not</u> use the &quot;Signin with Google&quot;option! :</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a Qwiklabs account setup using your university email address, it will automatically be added to a Qwiklabs group that will give all students access to free Qwiklabs credits to run the weekly Qwiklabs tasks. Please note you will see a Qwiklabs credit value that may be in the 1000s, note this is a <strong>pool of credits</strong> for all students to use, so dont be alarmed if you notice this value going down more than the credits you have personally used.</p>
<h3>Lab 1a</h3>
<p>Please login to your Qwilabs account and complete the<strong> Tour of Google Cloud Hands-on Labs</strong> lab <a href="https://www.qwiklabs.com/catalog_lab/1281">here</a>. Remember to take note of the temporary GCP crtedentials details on the left side of the lab (as shown below), as these are the connection credentials unique to you and the lab you are doing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> At this point you have completed the main task for during the workshop session, however you may have time for labs below. </p>
<h3>Lab 1b</h3>
<p>Before you begin this lab there is a part that students may find confusing. When the lab asks you to use a command to  "Identify your default region and zone", and you do not see the value, then just use the zone value of <strong>us-central1-a</strong> whenever the lab asks you to set the zone. You will be good to go.</p>
<p>Please login to your Qwilabs account and complete the<strong> Getting Started with Cloud Shell &amp; gcloud</strong> lab <a href="https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/563?parent=catalog">here</a> &lt; PLEASE ENSURE YOU DO THIS LAB!</p>
<h3>Lab 1c</h3>
<p>Please login too your Qwiklabs account and complete&nbsp; the <strong>Creating a Virtual Machine</strong> lab <a href="https://google.qwiklabs.com/focuses/3563?parent=catalog">here</a> - this is classed as cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is all for this week and you should now know the basics of finding your way around the Google Cloud Platform. In later workshops you will use your personal Google Cloud Project space to create resources, but for now you will carry on learning through the use of Qwiklabs sandbox labs with no need to use your own project space.</p>
